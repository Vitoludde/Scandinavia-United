* When Monarkisterna gains a majority and controls more than 115 mandates they seize power and an event fires that changes the ruling party to non-aligned (base game politics system)
* When Socialdemokraterna gains a majority an event fires that gives Sweden an idea that's named Socialdemokraternas regering that gain certain buffs according to their ideology.
