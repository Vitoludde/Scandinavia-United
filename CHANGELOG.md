## Focuses

* You can no longer do Hansson government unless the Socialdemokraterna has a majority, it doesn't matter if they have a majority rule, they must have a majority of mandates.
* You can no longer do SKP unless SKP has a majority and a majority rule.
* You can no longer do Gustaf V following the same rules as SKP.
* You can no longer do Lindholmarna following the same rules as SKP.

The following focuses give mandates now instead of party popularity:

* Make the government vulnerable to fascism
* Spread the fascists ideas in the country
* SKP
* Folkhemmet
* L'etat c'est moi
* Hansson government
* Folkhemmet (democratic version)
* Social reforms
* Pro-allied censorship

These changes have been made so that the player can use their time focusing on economy and technology while still being able to influence the politics.

Removed following focuses:

* Give support to the monarchists
* Enforce Neutrality
* Abandon Neutrality

These focuses have been made obsolete following the creation of the parliament system

You can interact with these parties as you wish with the ability to boost and crack down on certain parties. It is planned so the popularity of the parties determine which focuses you can do.
